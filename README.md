# Simple-Linear-Regression

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of simple linear regression. The goal is to predict a dependent variable (Y) based on an independent variable (X).

Files
Newspaper.csv: Contains the dataset used for the regression analysis.

news_paper.ipynb: Python script to perform the linear regression.

README.md: Documentation for the project.

Requirements
Python 3.x

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Install the necessary packages using:

bash

Copy
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Load Dataset: Ensure data.csv is in the same directory as regression.py.

Run Script: Execute the Python script to perform the regression.

bash

Copy
python regression.py
Output: The script will output the regression line plot and coefficients.
